Welcome to Canvas Pong!

This is a repo for a project that I'm starting that is simply Pong built for HTML5 on CANVAS.

The basics are being taken from these guides: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Workflows/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript http://blog.mailson.org/2013/02/simple-pong-game-using-html5-and-canvas/ and then I decided to spice it up a bit with some code modularization (I'm a JS newbie, so it's an excuse to try out different things)

Player controls: up/down to move (right), w/s to move (left), space to pause/start
